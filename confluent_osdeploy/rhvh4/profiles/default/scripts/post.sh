# This script will execute in the installed system, but using the installer kernel prior to reboot.
# This is an appropriate place to run post install activities that do not require the actual installed
# kernel to run. For example adding drivers that would be needed for first boot to run cleanly.
# If, for example, there is a post script that has a dependency on a driver or filesystem that
# cannot work until booting into the installer, use firstboot.sh instead

# run_remote will download and execute from /var/lib/confluent/public/<os>/scripts/ directory
# run_remote_python will use the appropriate python interpreter path to run the specified script
# A post.custom is provided to more conveniently hold customizations, see the post.custom file.
